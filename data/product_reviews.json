The chip features an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for improved performance but lacks enhanced battery life despite the new pixel count. The hinge design has been simplified, resulting in a more durable and flat folding mechanism. The biggest change is the larger outside screen, named the flex window, which offers more functionality and customizable app usage.\n\nPOSITIVE KEYWORDS:\n- Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 (improved performance)\n- Hinge (simplified design, durability)\n- Cover screen (larger, functional)\n- Flex window (increased screen size, improved functionality)\n- Widgets (optimized for outside screen usage)\n- Fingerprint reader (super fast)\n- Storage (increased from 128 to 256 gigs)\n\nNEGATIVE KEYWORDS:\n- Battery life (no improvement despite new chip)\n- Pixel count (slight visibility on the outside screen)\n- Resolution (720p on the outside screen)\n- Refresh rate (60Hz on the outside screen, not matching inside)",
